*NotePasser* App is a note-taking app where I implemented React Server Components manually to understand what happens under the hood. Server-side rendering fetches notes asynchronously while client-side components handle interactivity, exploring hybrid rendering and full-stack React concepts.
A basic RSC app build without using any frameworks.
